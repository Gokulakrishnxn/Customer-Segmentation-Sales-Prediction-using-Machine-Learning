# Customer-Segmentation-Sales-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
# 📖 Introduction
This project segments mall customers into clusters and predicts sales using demographic and spending data. It demonstrates unsupervised learning (KMeans) and supervised regression (Linear Regression).

# 🎯 Objectives
 1. Segment customers into meaningful groups 
 2. Predict sales from customer attributes
 3. Provide business insights for marketing
